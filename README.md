# 3D-SARS-CoV-19-Protein-Visualization
This repo contains my scripts, codes and jupyter notebooks for the guided project on "3D SARS-CoV-19 Protein Visualization with Biopython"


I created an interactive three-dimensional (3D) representation of SARS-CoV-19 (Coronavirus) protein structures. Accomplished it in by completing each task in the project:

Task 1: Introduction to Biopython

Task 2: Understand FASTA file format

Task 3: Sequence manipulation using Biopython

Task 4: Transcription & Translation studies

Task 5: Perform Basic Local Alignment using NCBI-BLAST

Task 6: Reading PDB file

Task 7: Visualizing SARS-CoV-19 Protein structures
